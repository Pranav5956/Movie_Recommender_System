# Movie_Recommender_System
This repository contains the datasets and code required for the Winter Semester DBMS J component (2019-20). The code builds a basic hybrid movie recommender system using the datasets mined from the OMDb website(http://www.omdbapi.com) and the 'ratings' dataset from MovieLens(https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest). The code integrates the previously well known content-based filter and collaborative filter to construct a Content Boosted Collaborative Filter.
